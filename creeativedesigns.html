                <p class="description-text">In November of 2022, I began work for a client looking for a website for their custom apparel printing business.</p>
                <p class="description-text">I talked with the client and outlined their needs and key features that they would like the website to have. Being able to add, edit and remove all content including designs, apparel options, fonts and colours was a necessity for them. Quick to load and accessibility were also important as the website serves as a sort of reference guide for all customers looking for what options they have in creating custom apparel.</p>
                <p class="description-text">I created a mockup design using Figma that went through a couple iterations using feedback from the client. Once the design was finalized, I created a WordPress website using the Elementor plugin. I chose this route since the Elementor page editor allows the client a lot of flexibility in editing all content and the layout of the page at different screen sizes. Alongside the website that I created, I also created complete and personalized documentation that outlines the basics of WordPress, accessing the Elementor page builder, the basics of the Elementor plugin and a complete guide to adding, editing and removing content and sections of the website. I also gave recommendations for domain name and hosting, as well as performed the initial set up and publishing of the website.</p>
                <p class="description-text">After the website was hosted online, I made myself available for any questions regarding the documentation and running the website.</p>
